you left me dry
you left me dry
this room 
you locked me in
no drinking water inside
no hope inside
you left me dry
and i'm m so weak 
on my knees
trembling hands 
reaching nothing
can you tell me
if there's something 
above sea level?
cause there is 
no shore insight
no drinking water inside
these walls
no drinking water inside
no drinking water inside
can you feel that?
can you feel that?
can you feel that?
